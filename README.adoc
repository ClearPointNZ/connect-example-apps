TODO:

- add back in docker generation for everything, surface the docker core id back to central location 
- build kubernetes deployments for everything so people can do a mvn clean install and then under Docker run
  a local Kubernetes install and it will all work
- add a feature toggle service
- cleanup the e2e test dependencies
- ensure e2e tests run fully
- engineer the pipeline to use the toolbox version
